<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

<p align="justify"> I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ib-sizwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao"><b>Prof. Song Guo</b></a>, Fellow of IEEE and <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yFLW6jgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra"><b>Prof. Bin Xiao</b></a>, Fellow of IEEE. I received the Ph.D. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, supervised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pg2qGzQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN"><b>Prof. Jun Li</b></a>. Before that, I received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Xidian University, Xian, China, in 2014. From Jun. 2021 to Dec. 2021, I was a research intern (Rhinoceros Bird Project) at Tencent, Shenzhen, supervised by <b>Dr. Yong Cheng</b>. </p>

<p align="justify"> I mainly focus on privacy protection and optimization techniques for edge intelligence, such as federated learning, differential privacy and network resource allocation. I have published several prestigious papers at the top international AI conferences and journals. I am also served as a reviewer for several top conferences and journals, such as Nature Communications, PATTERNS, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, IEEE JSAC, IEEE TWC, IEEE TSP, IEEE JSTSP, IEEE TIFS, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TMC and etc. </p>
